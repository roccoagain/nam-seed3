# NAM Seed3

Neural amp modeling on the Daisy Seed3 using libDaisy, with three A2-Lite models:
Fender '65 Twin Reverb, Vox AC30 Chimey, and Marshall JCM800 (gain 5).

## Setup

On macOS, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and Apple's Command Line Tools
(`xcode-select --install`). On Ubuntu, the installer uses `apt-get` and requests
`sudo` access when needed. Run from the repository root:

```sh
bash scripts/install.sh
bash scripts/download_models.sh
make
```

`make install` runs the same installer. It installs the ARM compiler, DFU uploader,
and `jq`, then fetches
pinned versions of libDaisy and NAM Core. The download script saves the three
Tone3000 models to Git-ignored `models/local/`. The build embeds their weights
in the firmware. On Ubuntu, the installer also installs the build and download
prerequisites, including the ARM C/C++ libraries and Python 3.

## Upload and play

Hold **BOOT**, press and release **RESET**, then release **BOOT** to enter DFU mode.

```sh
make upload
make monitor
```

The firmware starts with Fender selected. Press a key in the serial monitor
to switch models or bypass; no Enter is needed:

| Key | Selection |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Clean bypass |
| `1` | Fender '65 Twin Reverb |
| `2` | Vox AC30 Chimey |
| `3` | Marshall JCM800 (gain 5) |

Audio runs at 48 kHz, with the left input processed and sent to both outputs.
Switching models or toggling bypass briefly interrupts playback. These are
amp-only models; cabinet filtering and hardware gain calibration are not implemented.

If multiple serial ports are connected, use `make monitor PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodem…`.
Exit the monitor with **Ctrl-A**, then **K**, then **Y**.

### Serial status

The firmware prints one status line per second:

```
--- NAM A2-Lite | 48-sample blocks @ 48 kHz | budget 1000 us/block | keys: 0=bypass 1=Twin65 2=AC30 3=JCM800 ---
[active Fender Twin65          ]  avg  61% ( 612 us)  peak  63% ( 627 us)  headroom   373 us  blocks 1000  overruns 0
>>> bypass
[bypass -                      ]  avg   0% (   2 us)  peak   0% (   3 us)  headroom   997 us  blocks 1000  overruns 0
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[mode amp]` | `active` with the running model, `bypass`, or `failed` if the model did not load (audio is bypassed). |
| `avg` | Mean audio-callback time over the last second, as a percentage of the block budget and in microseconds. |
| `peak` | Longest single callback over the last second. |
| `headroom` | Budget minus peak: how much slower the callback could get before an overrun. Negative means an overrun happened. |
| `blocks` | Callbacks in the last second (1000 at 48 samples per block and 48 kHz). |
| `overruns` | Callbacks that exceeded the budget in the last second. Lines with overruns are marked `<-- OVERRUN`. |

The header repeats every 20 lines, and `>>>` lines record model switches.

## Development

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `make` | Build firmware and embed all three models. |
| `make test` | Compare against upstream NAM and run sanitized host audio tests. |
| `make clean` | Remove build outputs; keep downloaded models and dependencies. |
| `make format` | Format C/C++ source in `src/` and `tests/`. |
| `make compiledb` | Generate the clangd compilation database. |
| `make help` | List commands. |

Formatting and clangd setup require `brew install clang-format compiledb`.
Host tests require a C++20 compiler.
